# lightbot

script.py transforms Maya meshes and curves into cartesian XYZ coordinates\

script2_parser.py parses through the input file containing XYZ coordinates and converts them into cable coordinates so that lightbot can move to the correct position

export_coordinate.py takes in pixel coordinates from the terminal, converts them to cartesian coordinates, then converts them to lightbot coordinates and writes it to the printer
